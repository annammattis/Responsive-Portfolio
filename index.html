                <p>Jersey girl, born and bred. I grew up on the waters of the Jersey Shore, no, not like the show, the one where Bruce Springsteen, Jon Bon Jovi, Charlie Puth, Queen Latifah, Joe Pesci, Jon Stewart, Jack Nicholson and Danny Devito grew up. Where the beaches are hot and so is everyone's temper. Here is where I developed my grit.</p>

                <p>As an inspired, young adult I have found starting a business takes more than the basic step-by-step process. This of course would include, having an idea, writing a business plan, accessing your finances, and making sure it’s legally structural. Although these steps are crucial to starting a business, there is more to the analytical steps of changing your life. That being said, this is what I have experienced to be the single greatest challenge that arises when you start your own business; Intention.</p>

                <p>I grew up in a family of Entrepreneurs. Growing up, my brothers and I were the kids on the block to wake up early and make lemonade and cookies to sell on the curb. The kids to buy cooler school supplies in bulk and sell to friends on the playground in middle school. The kids to offer services in high school to help train other kids for their next sport season. We’ve always been good at taking something we were good at and cashing in on it. At these young ages, our intention was to make money. To no surprise, as adults, we have tried to figure out ways to start our own businesses so we can cash in on what we know we can execute. But as an adult, these goals don’t come as easily. We realized we can’t just start a business to make money, we NEED to do something that we would go broke for, something that we would sacrifice for.</p>
 
                <p>I have always been interested in Software Engineering, since I was in middle school. The power that is behind this skill is immense and can change the way the world works. It already has, to how we communicate and connect with each other, to how we learn and adapt to the inevitable changes of our world. I do have a business plan, it’s to be there for people. To open a door for people that feel they don’t have any left. When I was a child, I lost my best friend to suicide. She was 14 and was extremely depressed. She dealt with a lot of trauma at home, and even the open door I had at my home for her wasn’t enough to make her feel safe. If I could go back and help her realize the weight of her decision, help her understand that there was always an option, I would do it in a heartbeat. I hope to be able to be that person for anyone else feeling the way she felt. If I could be there, even through the convenience of your screen, I WANT to be. I want to change the stigma on mental health and create a place for people struggling to be able to see a light, even if it may be dim, or through the screen on your device, I can be there. This is something that I would go broke for, I would sacrifice for.</p>
